### Overview
This project looks at the TMDB Movies Dataset to find patterns in movie production, budgets, and popularity using charts and statistics.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - TMDB Movies Dataset
- Analyzed trends in movie budgets and release dates, showing that budgets have grown and most movies come out during peak months
- Highlighted top-grossing films like Avatar and found Drama, Comedy, and Thriller as the most common genres
- Calculated the average movie runtime (about 109 minutes) and used boxplots to show the spread and outliers
